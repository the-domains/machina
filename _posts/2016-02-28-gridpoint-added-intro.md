I'm a Web Developer, User Interface Designer, underground dance music composer (wannabe), and an aspiring outdoorsman. I live in Silicon Valley and occasionally drive up to San Francisco for social events. This node on 'the grid' is created with an intent of highlighting my adventures in technology and life in general. 

My passion lies at the conflux of design, technology, usability, innovation, and the human experience. My work is guided by those factors. I derive immeasurable satisfaction from building innovative things and providing a positive experience to people.

I enjoy front-end development, and I also possess experience with full-stack JavaScript Web Development by way of Angular.js, Node.js, Express.js, and MongoDB. I'm also enthralled by good design, user experience, artificial intelligence (AI), Virtual Reality (VR), and the conceptual Internet of Things (IoT) .

Aside from design & technology, my interests include traveling, reading, meditation, nature, people, equality, and music (minimal, techno, house, ambient, downtempo). I'm blessed to have a beautiful wife along with a strong foundation of loving friends and family to accompany me through this journey of life. Thanks for visiting!
